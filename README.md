# Movie Tracker
### _A simple console program to track movies you want to see and ones you have seen. Built to give students an example of working with classes._

## Setup Instructions
- Clone this project
- Navigate to the project folder ("movieTracker" by default) in your terminal
- Run the program in your terminal with `dotnet run` (this command also installs dependencies and builds the project)
- Exit the program at any time by pressing `Ctrl + C` on Windows (`Cmd + C` on Mac)

## Technologies Used
- .NET Core 2.2
- <a href="https://www.ascii-art-generator.org/">ASCII Art Generator</a>

## Known Bugs and Future Improvements
- `Movie` needs an ID property so entries can be found and updated (related: rating a movie will always add a new one currently)
- Users should be able to view a list of their favorite movies -- any with a rating of 4 or 5 currently
- Users should see an indication of which movies they've seen already
